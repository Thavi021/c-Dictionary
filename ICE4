ICE TASK 4 – Dictionary and Recursion

Create a dictionary to store parent (province or city) which is the key and their leaf nodes (province or city). The items in the dictionary should be stored as follows:
•	Key: province or city
•	Value: index of the parent (key)
For example:
Dictionary.add(“South Africa”, -1) South Africa should be the first as all the provinces and cities belong to South Africa
Dictionary.add(“Gauteng”, 0) Gauteng belong to South Africa
Dictionary.add(“Pretoria”, 1) Pretoria belong to Gauteng
Dictionary.add(“Cape Town”, 0) You can add Western Cape as a parent for Cape Town, otherwise South Africa will be the parent
Etc… (Please add 4 more entries)

Now, to answer the question: use recursion to print out the parents and their leaf node. FindParent method takes leaf node as a parameter. See below sample input and output
Input	Expected output
FindParent(“Gauteng”)	South Africa
Gauteng
FindParent(“Pretoria”)	South Africa
Gauteng
Pretoria
